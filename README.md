# bank_churn
This is a mini project made using the concepts of neural networks and classification.
Here we are supposed to find if a customer has left or still staying with bank.
I used a 2 layer NN with 9 nodes and 5 nodes respectively and the last layer is output layer.
And upon this I applied Logistic Regression to get the final prediction.
